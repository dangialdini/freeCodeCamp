                Killswitch Engage is an American metalcore band from Westfield, Massachusetts, formed in 1999 after the disbanding of Overcast
                and Aftershock. Killswitch Engage's current lineup consists of vocalist Jesse Leach, guitarists Joel Stroetzel
                and Adam Dutkiewicz, bassist Mike D'Antonio, and drummer Justin Foley. The band has released seven studio
                albums and two live performance albums. Their latest album, Incarnate, was released on March 11, 2016.[2]
                Killswitch Engage rose to fame with its 2004 release The End of Heartache, which peaked at number 21 on the
                Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA in December 2007 for over 500,000 shipments in the United
                States. The title track, "The End of Heartache", was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Metal
                Performance, and a live DVD titled (Set This) World Ablaze was released in 2005. Killswitch Engage has performed
                at festivals such as Soundwave Festival, Wacken Open Air, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Ozzfest, Download
                Festival, Rock on the Range, Rock Am Ring, Mayhem Festival, Monsters of Rock, Pointfest, Knotfest and Heavy
                MTL. The band has sold over four million records in the U.S. and has been considered notable within the New
                Wave of American Heavy Metal, and has also been considered one of the earliest leading forces of the metalcore
                genre.
